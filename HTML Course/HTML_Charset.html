	<h1>HTML Encoding (Character Sets)</h1>
	<p>To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know which character set to use.</p>

	<u><h2>From ASCII to UTF-8</h2></u>
	<p>ASCII was the first character encoding standard. ASCII defined 128 different characters that could be used on the internet: numbers (0-9), English letters (A-Z), and some special characters like ! $ + - ( ) @ <span><</span> > .</p>
	<p>ISO-8859-1 was the default character set for HTML 4. This character set supported 256 different character codes. HTML 4 also supported UTF-8.</p>
	<p>ANSI (Windows-1252) was the original Windows character set. ANSI is identical to ISO-8859-1, except that ANSI has 32 extra characters.</p>
	<p>The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set, which covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world!</p>
	<u><h2>The HTML charset Attribute</h2></u>
	<p>To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know the character set used in the page.</p>
	<p>This is specified in the <span><</span>meta> tag:</p>
	<span><</span>meta charset="UTF-8">

	<h2><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_charset.asp">Differences Between Character Sets</a></h2>

	<u><h2>The ASCII Character Set</h2></u>
	<p>ASCII uses the values from 0 to 31 (and 127) for control characters.</p>
	<p>ASCII uses the values from 32 to 126 for letters, digits, and symbols.</p>
	<p>ASCII does not use the values from 128 to 255.</p>

	<u><h2>The ANSI Character Set (Windows-1252)</h2></u>
	<p>ANSI is identical to ASCII for the values from 0 to 127.</p>
	<p>ANSI has a proprietary set of characters for the values from 128 to 159.</p>
	<p>ANSI is identical to UTF-8 for the values from 160 to 255.</p>

	<u><h2>The ISO-8859-1 Character Set</h2></u>
	<p>ISO-8859-1 is identical to ASCII for the values from 0 to 127.</p>
	<p>ISO-8859-1 does not use the values from 128 to 159.</p>
	<p>ISO-8859-1 is identical to UTF-8 for the values from 160 to 255.</p>

	<u><h2>The UTF-8 Character Set</h2></u>
	<p>UTF-8 is identical to ASCII for the values from 0 to 127.</p>
	<p>UTF-8 does not use the values from 128 to 159. </p>
	<p>UTF-8 is identical to both ANSI and 8859-1 for the values from 160 to 255.</p>
	<p>UTF-8 continues from the value 256 with more than 10 000 different characters.</p>
