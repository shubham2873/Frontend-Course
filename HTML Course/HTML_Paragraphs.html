	<h1>HTML Paragraphs</h1>
	<p>The HTML <span><</span>p> element defines a paragraph.</p>
	<p>A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.</p>

	<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
	<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

	<u><h2>HTML Display</h2></u>
	<p>You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.
	</p>
	<p>Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.</p>
	<p>With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
	</p>
	<p>The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed.
	</p>

	<h3>Example</h3>
	<p>
		This paragraph
		contains a lot of lines
		in the source code,
		but the browser
		ignores it.
	</p>

	<u><h2>HTML Horizontal Rules</h2></u>
	<p>The <span><</span>hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
	</p>
	<p>The <span><</span>hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:
	</p>
	<p>The <span><</span>hr> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.
	</p>

	<h3>Example</h3>
	<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
	<p>This is some text.</p>
	<hr>
	<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
	<p>This is some other text.</p>
	<hr>

	<u><h2>HTML Line Breaks</h2></u>
	<p>The HTML <span><</span>br> element defines a line break.</p>
	<p>Use <span><</span>br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph.</p>
	<p>The <span><</span>br> tag is an empty tag, which means that it has no end tag.</p>

	<h3>Example</h3>
	<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>

	<u><h2>The Poem Problem</h2></u>
	<p>This poem will display on a single line:</p>
	<p>
		My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

		My Bonnie lies over the sea.

		My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

		Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
	</p>

	<u><h2>The HTML <span><</span>pre> Element</h2></u>
	<p>The HTML <span><</span>pre> element defines preformatted text.
	</p>
	<p>The text inside a <span><</span>pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:
	</p>
	<pre>
		My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

		My Bonnie lies over the sea.

		My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

		Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
	</pre>
