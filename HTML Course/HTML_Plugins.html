	<h1>HTML Plug-ins</h1>
	<p>Plug-ins are computer programs that extend the standard functionality of the browser.</p>

	<u><h2>Plug-ins</h2></u>
	<p>Plug-ins were designed to be used for many different purposes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>To run Java applets</li>
		<li>To run Microsoft ActiveX controls</li>
		<li>To display Flash movies</li>
		<li>To display maps</li>
		<li>To scan for viruses</li>
		<li>To verify a bank id</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Warning !</h4>
	<p>Most browsers no longer support Java Applets and Plug-ins.</p>
	<p>ActiveX controls are no longer supported in any browsers.</p>
	<p>The support for Shockwave Flash has also been turned off in modern browsers.</p>

	<u><h2>The <span><</span>object> Element</h2></u>
	<p>The <span><</span>object> element is supported by all browsers.</p>
	<p>The <span><</span>object> element defines an embedded object within an HTML document.</p>
	<p>It was designed to embed plug-ins (like Java applets, PDF readers, and Flash Players) in web pages, but can also be used to include HTML in HTML:</p>

	<h3>Example</h3>
	<object width="100%" height="500px" data="index.html"></object>
	
	<p>Or images if you like:</p>
	<object data="logo.png"></object>

	<u><h2>The <span><</span>embed> Element</h2></u>
	<p>The <span><</span>embed> element is supported in all major browsers.</p>
	<p>The <span><</span>embed> element also defines an embedded object within an HTML document.</p>
	<p>Web browsers have supported the <span><</span>embed> element for a long time. However, it has not been a part of the HTML specification before HTML5.</p>

	<h3>Example</h3>
	<embed src="logo.png">

	<p>Note that the <span><</span>embed> element does not have a closing tag. It can not contain alternative text.</p>

	<p>The <span><</span>embed> element can also be used to include HTML in HTML:</p>

	<h3>Example</h3>
	<embed width="100%" height="500px" src="index.html">
