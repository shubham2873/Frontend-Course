	<h1>HTML Entities</h1>
	<p>Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with character entities.</p>

	<p>Some characters are reserved in HTML.</p>
	<p>If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags.</p>
	<p>Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.</p>
	<p>A character entity looks like this:</p>
<pre>
&entity_name;

OR

&#entity_number;
</pre>

	<p>To display a less than sign (<) we must write: <span>&</span>lt; or <span>&</span>#60;</p>
	<p><b>Advantage of using an entity name:</b> An entity name is easy to remember.</p>
	<p><b>Disadvantage of using an entity name:</b> Browsers may not support all entity names, but the support for entity numbers is good.</p>

	<u><h2>Non-breaking Space</h2></u>
	<p>A commonly used entity in HTML is the non-breaking space: <span>&</span>nbsp;</p>
	<p>A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line.</p>
	<p>Two words separated by a non-breaking space will stick together (not break into a new line). This is handy when breaking the words might be disruptive.</p>

	<h3>Examples:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>§ 10</li>
		<li>10 km/h</li>
		<li>10 PM</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Another common use of the non-breaking space is to prevent browsers from truncating spaces in HTML pages.</p>
	<p>If you write 10 spaces in your text, the browser will remove 9 of them. To add real spaces to your text, you can use the <span>&</span>nbsp; character entity.</p>
	<p><b>Tip:</b> The non-breaking hyphen (<span>&</span>#8209;) is used to define a hyphen character (‑) that does not break into a new line.</p>

	<u><h2>Combining Diacritical Marks</h2></u>
	<p>A diacritical mark is a "glyph" added to a letter.</p>
	<p>Some diacritical marks, like grave ( ̀  ) and acute (  ́  ) are called accents.</p>
	<p>Diacritical marks can appear both above and below a letter, inside a letter, and between two letters.</p>
	<p>Diacritical marks can be used in combination with alphanumeric characters to produce a character that is not present in the character set (encoding) used in the page.</p>
