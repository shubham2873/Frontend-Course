	<h1>CSS Great Font Pairings</h1>
	<p>Great font pairings are essential to great design.</p>

	<u><h2>Font Pairing Rules</h2></u>
	<p>Here are some basic rules to create great font pairings:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Compliment</li>
		<p>It is always safe to find font pairings that complement one another.</p>
		<p>A great font combination should harmonize, without being too similar or too different.</p>

		<li>Use Font Superfamilies</li>
		<p>A font superfamily is a set of fonts designed to work well together. So, using different fonts within the same superfamily is safe.</p>
		<p>For example, the Lucida superfamily contains the following fonts: Lucida Sans, Lucida Serif, Lucida Typewriter Sans, Lucida Typewriter Serif and Lucida Math.</p>

		<li>Contrast is King</li>
		<p>Two fonts that are too similar will often conflict. However, contrasts, done the right way, brings out the best in each font.</p>
		<p>Example: Combining serif with sans serif is a well known combination.</p>
		<p>A strong superfamily includes both serif and sans serif variations of the same font (e.g. Lucida and Lucida Sans).</p>

		<li>Choose Only One Boss</li>
		<p>One font should be the boss. This establishes a hierarchy for the fonts on your page. This can be achieved by varying the size, weight and color.</p>
	</ol>

	<h3>Example</h3>
	<div class="one">
		<h1 class="one">Beautiful Norway</h1>

		<p class="one">Norway has a total area of 385,252 square kilometers and a population of 5,438,657 (December 2020). Norway is bordered by Sweden, Finland and Russia to the north-east, and the Skagerrak to the south, with Denmark on the other side.</p>

		<p class="one">Norway has beautiful mountains, glaciers and stunning fjords. Oslo, the capital, is a city of green spaces and museums. Bergen, with colorful wooden houses, is the starting point for cruises to the dramatic Sognefjord. Norway is also known for fishing, hiking and skiing.</p>
	</div>
