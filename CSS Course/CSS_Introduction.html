	<h1>CSS Introduction</h1>
	<p>CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.</p>

	<u><h2>What is CSS?</h2></u>
	<ul>
		<li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
		<li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
		<li>CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
		<li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>
	</ul>

	<u><h2>Why Use CSS?</h2></u>
	<p>CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.</p>

	<h3>Example</h3>
	<h1>This is Heading</h1>
	<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

	<u><h2>CSS Solved a Big Problem</h2></u>
	<p>HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!</p>
	<p>HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:</p>
	<span><</span>h1>This is a heading<span><</span>/h1><br>
	<span><</span>p>This is a paragraph.<span><</span>/p>

	<p>When tags like <span><</span>font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.</p>
	<p>To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.</p>
	<p>CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!</p>

	<u><h2>CSS Saves a Lot of Work!</h2></u>
	<p>The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.</p>
	<p>With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!</p>
